# hello-world
My first repository, ever!

My name is Chloe and I am still really new to the coding world, but it is my goal to learn as much as I can. 
Eventually, I would love to learn enough to secure a job as a entry level web developer.

Coding is still so new to me that any small thing that I learn, I am running around showing my family and friends what I accomplished (even if it is just a text-shadow on a fake webpage.)
